# Malk

This is a work-in-progress programming lanuage with the following aims:
  * Dependent types.
  * Linear types.
  * "Scripty" feel.
  * Simple. (small number of concepts and a small implementation).
  * Compiles down to efficient machine code.
  * Interactive editing and compilation.

### Status

The typechecker was half written and working but is currently disabled due to
the rest of the code being refactored underneath it. You can interactively edit
and run (in an interpretter) some code using the vim plugin.
